package Threding;
// In the multi-threading we can compute the or run processes at same time concurently

// Like Example: if you assign one thread for the tacking input from the user that recognise what user is input in the word file then the other side
//  if you assign another thread for the saving file then your work is going to result get faster and the efficiantly.

// Without threading:
// main() -> fun1() -> fun2() -> END

// With threading:
// main() + fun1() + fun2() -> End
// It's like if inside main fun. you tack input from user that time you not need to wait for user input(processor is free while user input) that time concurently another method fun1() and fun2() is RUN.  

// Types of creating thread in java:
// 1.By Extending Thread class.
// 2.By implimenting runable interface.
